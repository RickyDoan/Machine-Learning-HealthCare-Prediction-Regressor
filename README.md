# Predicting the Health Care Package Using Machine Learning - Python - Streamlit UI interface
### Streamlit url deployment : https://ricky-ml-heathcare-prediction.streamlit.app/

This project is the predict webpage testing system that consists of a Streamlit frontend application and using Regression model for training.

## Project Structure

* Iâ€™ve developed a Health Care Premium Prediction App using machine learning to estimate annual health insurance premiums
based on user inputs like age, medical history, income, lifestyle, and more.

* The app uses a predictive model trained on various factors such as stress levels, physical activity,
and medical conditions to generate premium predictions, helping users make informed decisions about their insurance plans.
  
### ðŸŒŸ What I love most about this project is:
* Easy-to-use interface with dynamic inputs
* Predicts insurance premiums based on personal data
* Built with Streamlit and deployed on Streamlit Cloud
* Hope you enjoy trying it out, and feel free to play around with the inputs to see how the predictions change! ðŸ˜„
